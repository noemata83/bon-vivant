# Bon Vivant Cocktail Companion API

This repo is for prototyping the backend of a cocktail book application. 

This application will allow users to contribute to a centralized database of cocktail recipes, assemble a subset of those recipes into a personalized cocktail book of favorite recipes, track which ingredients they have on hand, and use that  information to determine which cocktails they can mix now based on what they have on their shelf.

This repo contains the backend of the application, written in Node.js/Express, which exposes a GraphQL API.
